## Static Website Hosting

### Introduction
Hosting a static website in Azure involves using Azure Storage to serve static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images directly from a storage account.

### VM Configuration as a Web Server:
- **Windows:** Internet Information Services (IIS)
  - **Example:** Hosting a companyâ€™s internal documentation site.
- **Linux:** Apache2
  - **Example:** Hosting a personal blog or portfolio.

### Advantages of Static Website Hosting:
- **Ease of Use:** Provides a URL, HTTPS, and certificate automatically.
  - **Example:** Azure Static Web Apps automatically configures HTTPS for your custom domain.
- **Cost-Effective:** Cheaper and easier to manage compared to dynamic websites.
  - **Example:** Hosting a static site on Azure Blob Storage is more cost-effective than using a full-fledged web server.
- **Simplified Management:** Requires less maintenance and management.
  - **Example:** No need to manage server-side code or databases.

## Azure Storage Explorer

### Use Cases:
1. **Replicating a VM to Another VM:**
   - **Example:** Creating a backup of a production VM to a test environment.
2. **Replicating from One Tenant to Another Tenant:**
   - **Example:** Migrating data from a development tenant to a production tenant for deployment.

## Types of Test Storage
Disks in Azure are block-level storage volumes used with Azure VMs. There are two types: managed and unmanaged disks.

### Managed Disk:
- **Management:** Managed by Azure.
  - **Example:** Azure Premium SSD Managed Disks.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies management with built-in features.
  - **Example:** Automatic snapshots and backups.
- **Scalability:** Automatically scalable to meet demands.
  - **Example:** Scale up storage capacity without downtime.
- **Availability:** Azure handles availability checks and ensures redundancy.
  - **Example:** Built-in high availability and disaster recovery.
- **Backup:** Integrated backup solutions.
  - **Example:** Azure Backup service.
- **Cost:** Higher cost due to additional features and management.

### Unmanaged Disk:
- **Management:** Managed by the user.
  - **Example:** Manually attaching and managing VHD files.
- **Simplicity:** Simpler setup and configuration.
  - **Example:** Directly managing disk storage without Azure's automated features.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for low-level applications and environments where cost is a critical factor.
  - **Example:** Development environments with tight budgets.
- **Cost:** Lower cost, but requires more manual management and monitoring.

| Managed Disk      |       | Unmanaged Disk    |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
| Managed by Azure  |       | Managed by User   |
| Automatic Scaling |       | Manual Scaling    |
| High Availability |       | User-Managed HA   |
| Integrated Backup |       | Manual Backup     |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
